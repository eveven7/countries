Using https://restcountries.com free API make a visualized representation of counties that displays country name,
region, and area size. (Use https://restcountries.com/v2/all?fields=name,region,area to get only necessary data).
Requirements:
-  Create a repository using GIT and push your work to a remote (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab).
- Fetch the data from the endpoint.
-  Display a list for the data.
-  Make the list sortable alphabetically by name (ascending, descending).
-  Implement a filter(s) that filters countries:
- That are smaller than Lithuania by area.
- That are in “Oceania” region.
Here’s a wireframe as an example for your UI choices:
<div align="center">
